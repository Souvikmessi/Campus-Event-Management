# Campus Event Reporting — README File
1. my understanding of the problem

   The project is about building a Campus Event Management and Reporting System.Colleges can create and manage events (like Workshops, Seminars, Fests, Hackathons, etc.).Students can register for those events, mark attendance, and later submit feedback.The system should generate useful reports such as:Which events are most popular,Attendance summary,Feedback averages,Student participation history, and Top active students.In short, it’s a system to simplify event tracking and provide data insights to college admins.

2. Assumptions I made and why
    
     Each college has many students and events.

     An event can only be in one of three statuses: SCHEDULED, CANCELLED, COMPLETED → this keeps event management simple.

     A student can register only once per event (unique constraint), otherwise duplicates would mess up attendance.

     Attendance is marked only if the event is not cancelled.

     Used SQLite as the database since it is lightweight and easy to set up for a prototype

3. How to run the prototype (commands)
  1.Clone or download the project.
  2.Create the database:
    cd db
    sqlite3 app.db < schema.sql
  3.Start the backend (FastAPI + Uvicorn):
    cd api
    python -m uvicorn app:app --reload
  4.The server runs at http://127.0.0.1:8000
    you can check it with: http://127.0.0.1:8000/health  

4. API list you implemented
   Colleges: Create new college
   Students: Create new student
   Events: Create, Update status/venue
   Registrations: Student registers for event
   Attendance: Mark attendance
   Feedback: Submit or update feedback
   Reports: Event popularity, attendance summary, average feedback, student participation, top active students
   Health check: Verify server is alive

5. How to verify the reports
   Register multiple students for events → check /api/v1/reports/event-popularity.
   Mark attendance for some → check /api/v1/reports/attendance-summary/{college_id}/{event_id}.
   Submit feedback → check /api/v1/reports/avg-feedback/{college_id}/{event_id}.
   Look at individual student participation → /api/v1/reports/student-participation?college_id=1&student_id=101.
   Check who is most active → /api/v1/reports/top-active-students?college_id=1&limit=3.
   
6. What you would do next with more time
    Add frontend UI so students and admins don’t need to use raw API calls.
    Implement authentication & roles (student vs admin login).
    Enhance reports with graphs/charts for better visualization.
    Allow bulk attendance marking via QR code scanning.
    Add email/notification integration to remind students about events.
    Deploy the app on a cloud platform (like AWS/GCP/Heroku) for real usage.
